## Description

This plugin will give visitors an avatar theme of your choice if they don't have a Gravatar. It's developed by [iElectrify](http://ielectrify.com) and [Fahd Murtaza](http://www.fahdmurtaza.com).

Simply install the `wordpress-custom-avatars` plugin into your WordPress plugins folder (`/wp-content/plugins`) and activate it via the Dashboard.

If your WordPress theme does not support avatars (rare), simply add this snippet of code where you want the avatars to appear:

```php
<?php get_avatar(); ?>
```

Icons should be sized at 48x48 pixels. You can use a free graphics viewer/resizer such as [Irfanview](http://www.irfanview.com) to do this. To find themed icons for your blog, many of which are free for personal and commercial use, see [IconFinder](http://www.iconfinder.net).

When you have your icons, just add them to the `wordpress-custom-avatars/images` folder in your WordPress plugins area. That's it! Enjoy!

## Features
